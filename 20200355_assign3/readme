Arrays are easier to implement, and use less memory than hash tables.
However, they are slow when inserting and searching.
Hash tables are faster when inserting and searching than arrays.
However, they are trickier to implement and uses more memory.

I have implemented hash table expansion in 
int RegisterCustomer(DB_T d, const char *id, constchar *name, const int purchase)
using an if statement.

It took me 3-4 days. Searching the cause for memory leaks took a long time.
