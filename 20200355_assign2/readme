No it is not possible to call assert to verify the destination memory is large enough
It is impossible to know the memory size of a pointer, 
and strcopy only knows the information about the pointers.
However if you store that information in an allocator, the problem can be solved.

I only used pointer notation to implement part1.

It took me about 5 days. 
It took me long because I was confused about how '*' works, 
and thought it only indicated zero or more of the same repeated characters.
After figuring out this problem, it took me about 3 hours to implement part2.
